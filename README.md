This game was developed by me (Arturo Iafrate), Pasquale Celardo, Vincenzo Selvaggio, Giuseppe Fatigati, Raffaele Tramontano and Emanuele Violante during the T2 course at the iOS Foundation Program organized by the University of Naples "Parthenope" in partnership with Apple.

This TvOS app needs the iPhone companion app (remote controller for the TvOS app).

Videos are removed to avoid copyright issues. You can add your own in the iKnow folder.
Files are named from 1 to 28, START and END (for example, 12START.mp4 and 12END.mp4).
